### `_float`

#### `float`

The `float` function initializes a floating-point variable with a specified name and value, combining both an integer and fractional part.

Syntax:
```cmd
call :float name <whole_part> <[numerator]> <[denominator]>
```
Parameters:

- `name`        (string):  The name of the floating-point variable.
- `whole_part`  (integer): The whole number part of the value.
- `numerator`   (integer, optional): The numerator of the fractional part.
- `denominator` (integer, optional): The denominator of the fractional part.

Description: 
This function creates a floating-point variable by combining the whole part and fractional part, calculated as:

$` \text{data}=\text{whole\_part}*32768+\frac{\text{numerator}*32768}{\text{denominator}} `$

#### `float_add`
The `float_add` function adds one floating-point variable to another.

Syntax:
```cmd
call :float_add first second [to]
```

Parameters:
- `first`       (string):  The name of the first floating-point variable to add.
- `second`      (string):  The name of the second floating-point variable to add.
- `to`          (string, optional):  The name of the resulting variable.

Description: This function adds the value of the second floating-point variable to the first and stores the result in the variable specified by to. If no result variable (to) is provided, first will be updated with the result.

#### `float_subtract`
The float_subtract function subtracts one floating-point variable from another.

Syntax:

```cmd
call :float_subtract first second [to]
```

Parameters:
- `first` (string): The name of the first floating-point variable (minuend). If no result variable is provided, this will be updated with the result.
- `second` (string): The name of the second floating-point variable (subtrahend).
- `to` (optional, string): The name of the resulting floating-point variable that will hold the difference. If not provided, first will be updated with the result.

Description: This function subtracts the value of the second floating-point variable from the first and stores the result in the variable specified by to. If no result variable (to) is provided, first will be updated with the result.

#### `float_multiply`
The float_multiply function multiplies one floating-point variable by another.

Syntax:
```cmd
call :float_multiply first second [to]
```
Parameters:
- `first` (string): The name of the first floating-point variable (multiplicand). If no result variable is provided, this will be updated with the result.
- `second` (string): The name of the second floating-point variable (multiplier).
- `to` (optional, string): The name of the resulting floating-point variable that will hold the product. If not provided, first will be updated with the result.

Description: This function multiplies the values of the first and second floating-point variables and stores the result in the variable specified by to. If no result variable (to) is provided, first will be updated with the result.

#### `float_divide`
The float_divide function divides one floating-point variable by another.

Syntax:
```cmd
call :float_divide first second [to]
```

Parameters:
- `first` (string): The name of the first floating-point variable (dividend). If no result variable is provided, this will be updated with the result.
- `second` (string): The name of the second floating-point variable (divisor).
- `to` (optional, string): The name of the resulting floating-point variable that will hold the quotient. If not provided, first will be updated with the result.

Description: This function divides the value of the first floating-point variable by the value of the second floating-point variable and stores the result in the variable specified by to. If no result variable (to) is provided, first will be updated with the result. If second is zero, the function may handle division by zero based on the system's error-handling configuration.
